This website was built in order to meet Web Technology module's requirements for the coursework.
I built this website for informative and advertisement purposes, to advertise Fuel Cards and keep people informed about the company and overall product. The design was taken from original website https://tsst.ai/ 
In terms of design, colors and pictures were used, yet the design of the pages and tables was different than the original. The website consists of 6 pages, each one giving information about product. 
The main reason why I chose to bbuild this website is the company. Previously, I used to work for TSS, I was a salesman, we used to sell this fuel cards to US drivers, yet the office is in Tashkent. So, decided to make a website of the compaany that I am familiar with. Explicit usage of CSS and HTML and little usage of JAVASCRIPT code can be seen. The website did not seem to rquire much of javascript code, so it was not used that much. 
All pages of the website run, to check the hosting website go to this link:
